# Bat Shotgun Metagenomic Flow-work

> This is the repository for supplementary materials for the upcoming publication

The data analysis of shotgun metagenomic data from bats fecal samples was so complex that there are 4 different parts of it!<br>
See lab journals and some supplementary files in directories:
- 📁 [`01_QC_n_tax_id`](01_QC_n_tax_id) - quality control & taxonomic identification step
- 📁 [`02_Diff_analysis`](02_Diff_analysis) - microbial community analysis (relative abundance, differential abundance analysis, α & β diversities assessment)
- 📁 [`03_Metagenomes`](03_Metagenomes) - assembling metagenomes and analyzing them from quality control to the detailed functional profiling
- 📁 [`04_Densoviruses`](04_Densoviruses) - analyzing _densoviruses_ (genome annotation, ANI, phylogenomics)
